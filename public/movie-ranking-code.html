    <h3>5. Avatar</h3>
    This movie and its sequel are just "naturally" engaging, and visually enthralling!
    <h3>6. Godzilla: King of the Monsters</h3>
    Just two mega-sized reptiles with laserbeam breaths duking it out.
    <h3>7. Godzilla vs. Kong</h3>
    EVEN MORE mega-sized kaiju clashing!
    <h3>8. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</h3>
    I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is a classic for me.
    <h3>9. Whiplash</h3>
    Very intense movie, you feel quite a lot.
    <h3>10. The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
    The animation is just out of this world.
